## Overview:  

### 1. Motivation

Marketing a new product directly to clients is often an expensive task undertaking by many companies. However, what if there was a smarter and more efficient way to direct your resources so you only contact clients that you believed were willing to sign-up or purchase a new product? This was the case with a Portuguese Bank that had a new fixed term deposit that they wanted to market to their existing clients. Our goal was to develop a model that given a set of customer features could predict whether or not that customer would sign-up for this new term deposit.

### 2. Dataset:

Inputs = 15 attributes of existing bank customers and datatype  

| Data Type   | Variables   |
|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| numeric     | age, balance, day, campaign, previous |
| categorical | job, marital, education, default, housing, loan, contact, month, poutcome, pdays|

### 3. Question
**Type:** Predictive

- _Will an existing bank customer sign up to a new term deposit through a direct marketing campaign?_

### 4. Background

![](./results/imgs/data_loaded.jpg)  

The dataset was generated by a phone marketing campaign run by a Portuguese bank. The campaign aimed to encourage the bank's existing customers to sign up for a new term deposit. The dataset contains ~45,000 examples with both quantitative and qualitative data on 20 features for each customer. The dataset also includes the final result of previous campaign that indicates successful sign-ups.  


### 5. Project Objective

-  To build a Decision Tree Classifier to identify which characteristics of the clientele will lead to subscription to the new bank product.
