### 2. Question
**Type:** Predictive

_Will an existing bank customer subscribe to a new term deposit through a direct marketing campaign?_

### 3. Script

**Summary of the data:**

![](./results/imgs/data_loaded.jpg)  

The dataset was generated by a phone marketing campaign run by a Portuguese bank . The campaign aimed to encourage the bank's existing customers to sign up for a new term deposit. The dataset contains ~45,000 examples with both quantitative and qualitative data on 20 features for each customer.  The dataset also includes the final result of the campaign that indicates the successful sign-ups.  


**Language:** Python
  - **Dependencies:**
    1. Pandas

### 4. Plan

We are going to build a Decision Tree Classifier to identify which characteristics of the clientele will lead to subscription to the new bank product.

1. **Importing and cleaning data**- For variables, we will only consider the 15 customers' attributes. We exclude `duration` because duration of the calls does not predict the duration of the next call. In addition, we will also exclude other social and economic attributes because they are macro-economic factors that are not directly related to the customers that we want to study. All the variables that are excluded are crossed out in Part 1 for viewers'reference.


2. **Hyperparameter for Decision Tree** - we will use k-fold cross-validation to pick the maximum depth of the tree.


### 5. Presentation:

- [ ] Decision Tree Model to predict whether or not an existing customer will sign up for a new bank product through the new marketing campaign. We will provide:

  - The full tree in pdf as a reference
  - The top three layers of the tree
  - Present the prediction result for 2-3 customers
  - Test accuracy for the final model  


- [ ] Table to summarize the features selected by the classifier

  - This table ranks all of the customer features used in the model by Gini importance
