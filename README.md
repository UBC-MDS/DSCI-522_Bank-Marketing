![](./imgs/data_loaded.jpg)  

The dataset was generated by a phone marketing campaign run by a Portuguese bank . The campaign aimed to encourage the bank's existing customers to sign up for a new term deposit. The dataset contains ~45,000 examples with both quantitative and qualitative data on 20 features for each customer.  The dataset also includes the final result of the campaign that indicates the successful sign-ups.  

**Language:** Python
  - **Dependencies:**
    1. Pandas

### 4. Plan

We are going to build a Decision Tree Classifier to identify which characteristics of the clientele will lead to subscription to the new bank product.

### 5. Presentation:

- [x] Decision Tree Model to predict the characteristic of high potential subscribers

- [ ] Table to summarize the features selected by the classifier

- [ ] Conclusion to interpret the final result.
