The dataset is related to a phone marketing campaign run by a Portuguese bank where they are trying to sign existing customers up to a new term deposit. The dataset contains ~45,000 examples with data on 20 features for each customer, there are both quantitative and qualitative features. As well, for each example we know whether or not they signed up for the new term deposit.  

**Languague:** Python
  - **Dependencies:**
    1. Pandas

### 4. Plan

We are going to build a Decision Tree Classifier to identify which characteristics of the clientele will lead to subscription to the new bank product.

### 5. Presentation:

- [ ] Decision Tree Model to predict the characteristis of high potential suscribers

- [ ] Table to summarize the features selected by the classifier

- [ ] Conclusion to interpret the final result.
