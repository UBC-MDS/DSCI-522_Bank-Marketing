## Overview:  

### 1. Motivation  
Marketing a new product directly to clients is often an expensive task undertaking by many companies. However, what if there was a smarter and more efficient way to direct your resources so you only contact clients that you believed were willing to sign-up or purchase a new product? This was the case with a Portuguese Bank that had a new fixed term deposit that they wanted to market to their existing clients. Our goal was to develop a model that given a set of customer features could predict whether or not that customer would sign-up for this new term deposit.

### 2. Dataset:

#### Inputs = 15 attributes of existing bank customers and datatype  
| Data Type   | Variables   |
|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| numeric     | age, balance, day, campaign, previous |
| categorical | job, marital, education, default, housing, loan, contact, month, poutcome, pdays|

### 3. Question
**Type:** Predictive

_Will an existing bank customer sign up to a new term deposit through a direct marketing campaign?_

### 4. Background

![](./results/imgs/data_loaded.jpg)  

The dataset was generated by a phone marketing campaign run by a Portuguese bank. The campaign aimed to encourage the bank's existing customers to sign up for a new term deposit. The dataset contains ~45,000 examples with both quantitative and qualitative data on 20 features for each customer. The dataset also includes the final result of previous campaign that indicates successful sign-ups.  


### 5. Plan

We are going to build a Decision Tree Classifier to identify which characteristics of the clientele will lead to subscription to the new bank product.

1. **Importing and cleaning data**- For variables, we will only consider 15 customer attributes. We excluded `duration` because when predicting whether or not a customer will sign up if they are contacted, it is impossible to know the duration of the call beforehand . In addition, we will also exclude the social and economic attributes: `emp.var.rate, cons.price.idx, cons.conf.idx, euribor3m, and nr.employed` because they are macro-economic factors that are not directly related to the customers that we want to study.

2. **Data Visualization** - For categorical variables, seaborn catplot will be used to plot the variable of interest against the target variable, which is `sign-up `. For continuous variables, seaborn boxplot will be used instead.

3. **Hyperparameter for Decision Tree** - we will use k-fold cross-validation to pick the maximum depth of the tree.

### 6. Presentation:

- [x] Decision Tree Model to predict whether or not an existing customer will sign up for a new bank product through the new marketing campaign. We will provide:

  - The full tree in pdf as a reference
  - The top two layers of the tree
  - Test accuracy for the final model  

- [x] Table to summarize the features selected by the classifier

  - This table ranks all of the customer features used in the model by Gini importance
